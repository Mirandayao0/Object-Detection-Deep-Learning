The gif shows the trust changes of AI during the switch time from game panel to detecting panel.
step1: check distribution -- know the range of heatmap
step2: loop over eye1.txt to check time stamp, eye tracking coordinate,and confidence level
step3: loop over toggle out.csv to check panel switch time, exam the duration of trust changes
start time: trust AI ,didn't switch to panel, end time: not enough trust, switch to panel to check enemy by himself
step4: find overlap time,during the eye location changes, how confidence level changes, this reveal the trust on AI

how long do the eye track changes need to impact the trust level?
